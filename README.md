# hello-world

Hey fellow Biers.

'Bier' is german for beer.
Exciting.

Even more exciting: My last name is Bier(==Beer)!

A bit disappointing: My real name is neither Beate nor Bier.

But to ease your disappointment: Beate Bier is a real person, I have even talked to!
I hope this revelation made your day as it has made mine, a long time ago.

Cheers!
